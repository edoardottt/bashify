# bashify
Powershell profile to bashify your Windows prompt

How does it work? üîç
--------
Read more about profiles [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-7.2).  
If you can't run the script it's likely you should change your [execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2). Remember to restore it once finished. 

Installation üì•
------
- Locate the Powershell home with `echo $PSHOME` (likely to be `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0`)
- Save the file `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` (with this exact name) inside that folder
- Close the terminal and reopen it
